							<h2>Thoughts on our last date</h2>
							<p style="color:black;">We talked a lot about your past experiences, and I am really glad you opened up and were honest about it. I understand that close physical contact and constant hugging with your friends of opposite sex is something that is important to you, and I don't want you to change that either.<br><br>I know that your crush/best friend of 3 years will always hold a special place in your heart(It's okay to cry) and i am not even sure I can even surpass that. But if it doesn't, I want you to know that it's perfectly okay.<br><br>Dont worry to much about it. Even if things doesnt work, we can still cherish the time we spend together. Ultimately, i still hope we can overcome this situations together and strengthten the bond between us.</p>

							<h2>First Date as a Couple</h2>
							<p>The Mango was awesome (since you're sharing it with me)! The funniest thing was when you told me how surprised the lady was when I fed you the ice cream. It made me so happy when we were hugging. The hug was way too short.</p>

							<h2>First Serious Talk about the relationship</h2>
							<p>I was pretty nervous before we discuss about our relationship. I wasn't sure if our values and dating goals matched up. Luckily, most of them did! Holding your hand felt amazing, and I loved all the gifts you gave me! The best one was when you asked if you could call me your boyfriend.</p>

							<h2>First Escape room</h2>
							<p>The date was fun! We talked and connected so much. The fortune teller part was my favorite. I felt so bad when you were shivering while we waited for the escape room. But, we still had a great time, even though we couldn't finish it. And at the airport, I seriously wanted to give you a big hug!</p>

							<h2>First Movie</h2>
							<p>I saw this pro coder(cute girl sitting beside me) coding on a MacBook without mouse! It was insane! The Detective Conan movie was fun though! We should have bought a couple seat! Why did you abandon Gojo!!!!</p>

							<h2>First Hike</h2>
							<p>So, the reason I thought we should go hiking was because my fren said it's a sneaky way to hold hands while walking. But I was too shy to make a move. By the way, it was hilarious watching you attend your daily stand-up while eating the Mac pancake!!</p>

							<h2>First Date</h2>
							<p>So, when I met you for the first time, my initial thought was, "Wow, you are cute and pretty." But also weird in a good way. You surprised me by saying, "I'm gonna get fired" with a shocked expression. I couldn't help but laugh and wondered why that was the first thing you told me. 
								Anyway, the conversation went really well and we really clicked. Although the arcade turned out to be a bit boring, haha! It's a shame we couldn't sit together on the bus ride back.</p>
